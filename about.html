  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    I started out in technical theatre and live events, designing and running lighting, sound, and networked control systems. Working in that world meant dealing with high-pressure
    moments where things had to work — and it taught me how to stay composed, solve problems fast, and keep systems reliable when the stakes were high.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Cyber Security?</h2>
  <p>
    The same mindset that kept shows alive now drives my cybersecurity work: anticipating problems, breaking things apart to understand them,
    and building reliable solutions. I’ve been expanding my skills through TryHackMe, HackTheBox, homelab experiments, and formal study.

  <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
  <p>
    This portfolio is where I share <a href="/projects">projects</a>, write-ups on challenges and labs, and longer reflections in the <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
    I also maintain a structured <a href="https://0xkb.n0signal.dev">knowledge base</a> of my learning process. It’s a work in progress, but it’s my way of stacking wins and tracking growth.
